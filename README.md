# Esma'a
Esma’a is a mobile application designed to bridge the communication gap between Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing individuals and hearing people. The app recognizes Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) hand gestures using advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning, then converts them into clear Arabic text and spoken speech.
This system aims to make communication more accessible, inclusive, and instant for users.

**Features**
- **Real-Time Sign Recognition:** Detects Arabic Sign Language gestures live using MediaPipe and a fine-tuned CNN model (EfficientNetB0).
- **Sign-to-Text Conversion:** Translates recognized gestures into Arabic characters and full sentences.
- **Text-to-Speech Output:** Uses Microsoft Edge-TTS to convert translated text into clear Arabic audio.
- **Cross-Platform Mobile App:** Built using Flutter for Android and iOS.
