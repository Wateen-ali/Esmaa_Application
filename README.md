# Esma'a
Esma’a is a mobile application designed to bridge the communication gap between Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing individuals and hearing people. The app recognizes Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) hand gestures using advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning, then converts them into clear Arabic text and spoken speech.
This system aims to make communication more accessible, inclusive, and instant for users.
